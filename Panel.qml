// Workspace name: shows the name and the icon given to the current workspace,
// and lets you set them.
//
// The widget takes up no room at all until a workspace has one or the other,
// so a bar with this in it looks untouched until you start using it.
//
// Names and icons live one per file in $XDG_STATE_HOME/workspace-hud/<id> and
// <id>.icon, plain text, no daemon and no database. Anything else you run can
// read the current name with a cat, and writing one from a script is a
// redirect. Both files are watched, so the bar picks that up without being
// told. The directory is yours alone, though: what you call your workspaces
// says what you are working on, so it is kept at 700 with 600 files.
//
// It can draw the workspace indicators as well, off by default. An icon is
// only half useful on the workspace you are already on; the row of numbers is
// where you look to find the one you want. Turned on, this widget replaces
// omarchy.workspaces rather than sitting next to it, which is what keeps the
// two from ever showing different icons for the same workspace.
